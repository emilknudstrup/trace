shazam
================
This is the API for the shazam module. This module is mainly built to extract spectra from the SONG `(Grundahl et al. 2017) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...836..142G/abstract>`_ and FIES `(Telting et al. 2014) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AN....335...41T/abstract>`_ spectrographs, and then subsequently to create the cross-correlation function (CCF), or broadening functions (BF). From this it's possible to extract the radial velocity and projectec rotational velocity of the star.

shazam
================
This is the API for the shazam module. This module is mainly built to extract spectra from the SONG :cite:p:`Grundahl2017` and FIES :cite:p:`Telting2014` spectrographs, and then subsequently to create the CCF, or broadening function (BF). From this it's possible to extract the radial velocity and/or projected rotational velocity of the star.
